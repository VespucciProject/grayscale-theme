                <h2>About Vespucci</h2>
                <p>Vespucci is a software package for the analysis of spectroscopic data, including Raman, infrared, and UV-Vis spectroscopies. Vespucci provides an intuitive graphical user interface for the performance of common spectroscopic data analysis methods with no coding required.</p>
                <p>Unlike most commercial software for this purpose, Vespucci is free, open-source (GPL v3) and regularly tested on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux operating systems.</p>
                <p>A <a href="http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jors.91/">manuscript</a> detailing Vespucci has been published in the <i>Journal of Open Research Software.</i>
