                <h3>User Interface</h3>

                <p>Vespucci has an intuitive graphical user interface to make
                performing spectroscopic data analysis easy. 
                Vespucci is designed to abstract away the dependence of chemometric
                analysis on writing code.

                <h3>Spectral Processing</h3>
                <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-5">
                            <img src="img/before_proc.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-height:400px"/>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-5">
                            <img src="img/after_proc.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-height:400px"/>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Vespucci supports several commonly-used (pre)processing
                methods for spectroscopic data, including smoothing (median,
                moving average, Savitzky-Golay, gaussian), rank-reduction of the 
                spectra matrix through singular value decomposition,
                and baseline correction.</p>
                <h3>Univariate Analysis</h3> 
                <div class="container">
                    <img src=img/univariate.png class="img-responsive" style="max-height:400px"/>
                </div>
                <p>Vespucci supports analysis by peak area, intensity and width,
                both with and without local baseline adjustment, and allows for
                the determination of ratios between regions.</p>
                <h3>Multivariate Analysis</h3>
                <p>Vespucci supports principal component analysis, vertex components
                analysis, k-means clustering and partial least squares for classification,
                calibration and discrimination. Multivariate methods can be 
                performed on entire spectra or on data derived from other 
                analyses (k-Means on PCA, PCA on univariate, etc.)</p>
                <!-- Upcoming features to add
                <h3>Peak Detection</h3>
                <p> Vespucci provides peak detection and database lookup, informing 
                you about potential assignments. You can customize your peak database
                through Vespucci or by editing a simple YAML file.</p>
                <h3>Macro System</h3>
                <p> Vespucci provides a simple-to-use macro system to automate
                pre-processing and analysis techniques allowing you to perform
                the same operations on every dataset reproducibly.</p>
                <h3>Python Integration</h3>
                <p> Vespucci provides an interface between its data objects and 
                NumPy, allowing you to use the many data analysis functions 
                availible in the Python ecosystem. You can automate the use of 
                Python scripts, allowing them to be run from the Vespucci graphical
                user interface. Through this interface, you can also make use of
                other languages such as R or MATLAB through Python.</p>
                <h3>HDF5 Data Format</h3>
                <p> Vespucci saves datasets in the HDF5, allowing the output of
                Vespucci methods to be easily readible in software such as MATLAB</p>
